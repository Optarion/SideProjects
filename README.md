# SideProjects
A list of Side Projects I should work on

* RATP's next stop schedule
Create a desktop/mobile app that uses RATP's API to display the delay before a bus/metro/rer arrive at a stop.
* WebSite Validators Automation
Use a crawler to automatically make tests on main website validators (YellowLab, W3C, PageSpeedInsight...).
* "Microformat" Test Automation
Use a crawler to automatically tests page's "microformats" in facebook/twitter/google.
* IMG Compression Automation
Create a script that compress all files in a directory before launching in production and/or when user add new image into backoffice (as in SPIP for example).
